        Built a 5-node cluster in Docker with log replication and consensus, using Java/Spring Boot and 3 Docker images for replication.
        Carried out 5 multi-threaded, object-oriented components for RPC between nodes.
        Designed a Vue.js front-end app to collect and pass data to leader node, succeeding replication in other 4 nodes.
        Utilized Postgres database images in Docker for each node's storage.
        The implementation includes leader election, vote requests, follower node voting, and safe log replication with consistency checks and accomplished fault tolerance up to 98%.
